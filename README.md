# cellphone recommendation system using Surprise, a Python library for building collaborative filtering models.
This  case study focuses on developing a cellphone recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. By leveraging the LightFM library and the Surprise package, the project aims to recommend the best cellphones to users based on their preferences and past ratings. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes information on cellphone specifications such as performance rating (AnTuTu), memory size, camera resolution, battery capacity, screen size, and release date, along with user demographics like age, gender, and occupation. The system utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to train models, evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE, and generate personalized recommendations. Additionally, data visualization techniques help analyze model performance and rating distributions. The project aims to enhance user experience by providing accurate and relevant cellphone recommendations, addressing real-world challenges such as cold-start problems and sparsity in recommendation systems.
